	<p>
		<span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span>, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. Over 97% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.

		<div style="background-color: green; color: white;">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
